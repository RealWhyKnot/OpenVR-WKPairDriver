// Local re-declaration of the upstream VRCFaceTracking ExtTrackingModule surface.
// This mirrors the public contract of VRCFaceTracking.Core.Params.IExtTrackingModule
// as it existed at the time of the fork, without taking a NuGet dependency on
// the upstream SDK. Porting a vendor module is a matter of implementing this
// interface and wrapping it with ExtTrackingModuleAdapter.
//
// Upstream reference: https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking
// Interface stability: upstream does not guarantee binary compat across major
// versions; re-confirm field layout when porting a module written against a
// different upstream SDK version.
