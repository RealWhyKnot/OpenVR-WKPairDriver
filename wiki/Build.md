# Build environment

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio Build Tools 2022** (or the VS 2022 IDE) with the C++ workload installed, plus the Windows 10 SDK component.
- **CMake 4.x** -- the build wraps `-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5` because the `minhook` submodule pins `cmake_minimum_required(2.8.12)` which CMake 4 rejects.
- **.NET 10 SDK** -- needed by the face-tracking host (`WKOpenVR.FaceModuleHost`). The build is gated by the `OPENVR_PAIR_BUILD_FACE_HOST` CMake option (default `ON`); pass `-DOPENVR_PAIR_BUILD_FACE_HOST=OFF` to skip if the SDK is unavailable. With the host disabled the driver still loads, but the FaceTracking feature stays inert (the supervisor logs once that the host exe is missing).
- **NSIS** -- only needed when building the installer; release CI does this step. Local dev builds skip the installer unless `-Release` is passed.

## One-shot build

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RealWhyKnot/WKOpenVR
cd WKOpenVR
./build.ps1
```

`build.ps1` activates `.githooks/` via `core.hooksPath` on first run, stamps `version.txt` and `modules/calibration/src/overlay/BuildStamp.h`, configures via CMake (`-G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64`), runs MSBuild, then stages the C# face-tracking host into the driver tree at `build/driver_wkopenvr/resources/facetracking/host/`. Output:

- `build/artifacts/Release/WKOpenVR.exe` -- umbrella overlay
- `build/driver_wkopenvr/bin/win64/driver_wkopenvr.dll` -- shared driver
- `build/driver_wkopenvr/resources/facetracking/host/WKOpenVR.FaceModuleHost.exe` -- face-tracking sidecar (when the host build is enabled)

## Incremental builds

`./build.ps1 -SkipConfigure` skips the CMake configure step and just reruns MSBuild. Useful when iterating on a single source file.

`./quick.ps1` is the local SteamVR iteration path. It builds first, checks that the overlay, driver, sidecar hosts, and resources exist, then closes SteamVR and Steam for the deploy copy. The elevated copy installs the overlay files, copies the full `build/driver_wkopenvr/` tree into SteamVR as `drivers/01wkopenvr/`, renames the driver DLL to `driver_01wkopenvr.dll`, preserves existing `resources/*.flag` module toggles, verifies hashes, and relaunches SteamVR through Steam. Useful switches:

- `./quick.ps1 -SkipConfigure` -- incremental build, deploy, and restart.
- `./quick.ps1 -SkipBuild` -- redeploy the current `build/` outputs.
- `./quick.ps1 -SkipBuild -DryRun` -- validate the deploy file list without stopping or copying.
- `./quick.ps1 -NoRestart` -- deploy and verify without launching SteamVR.

## Release packaging

`./build.ps1 -Release` produces a release-shaped zip under `release/` alongside the build outputs. The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) does the same staging on a tag push and additionally builds the umbrella + per-feature NSIS installers. See the [release process](Release-Process) page.

## PowerShell 5.1 gotchas

The default Windows shell is PowerShell 5.1, which wraps every stderr line from a native command as a `NativeCommandError` ErrorRecord. Under `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` that wrap kills the script on the first CMake `message()` line; under `Continue` the lines still render with the noisy `+ CategoryInfo ... NativeCommandError` preamble that buries real diagnostics.

`build.ps1` wraps native commands in `Invoke-NativeQuiet`, which coerces ErrorRecord into plain strings and preserves `$LASTEXITCODE` across the pipe. Reuse this pattern when adding new native invocations to the build scripts.

## Tests

The gtest suite covers calibration, inputhealth, facetracking, OSC routing, and captions logic. Run:

```
./test.ps1
```

`test.ps1` builds by default, then enumerates every `build/artifacts/Release/*_tests.exe` and runs each with `--gtest_brief=1`. Pass `-SkipBuild` to run the existing binaries or `-Filter <pattern>` to pass a GoogleTest filter. `release.yml` runs the same `*_tests.exe` set; any non-zero exit fails the release.
